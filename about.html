    <h1>Welcome to my website project</h1>
    <h3>About my project</h3>
    <p>The goal of this project is to create a space for students to connect via study groups. Users can sign up to create their own events and upload a profile picture that will be associated with their username. Events can be updated by deleting and recreating the event. All events created are public. Site visitors can search for groups within five miles of the entered zipcode using an API from zipwise.com (note: to use an API that searches beyond five miles is a paid service). Additionally, visitors can email the group owner by clicking on their name and get a map of the location by clicking on the address.
